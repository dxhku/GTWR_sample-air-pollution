 ## Accuracy Metrics
 Scatter plots of cross-validation (CV) and perdition results for the GTWR-STK model. The scatter frequency is indicated by different colors. The dashed and solid lines represent the 1:1 line and the linear regression line, respectively. Y is prediction Ozone/NO<sub>2</sub> and X is observed Ozone/NO<sub>2</sub>.

 ## Data Availability
   Due to factors such as weather conditions and cloud cover, the accuracy of the tropospheric NO2 vertical column density is compromised, leading to missing values in the daily mapping results of NO2 and ozone concentrations in small areas.
